# React Calendar Challenge

Someone's idea of a 'senior developer' is the ability to rush truckloads of features in ridiculous deadlines.
Check out the [problem statement](https://developerjobsboard.co.uk/2018/07/28/an-example-senior-react-redux-developer-task/).
The time allowed is **90 minutes!**. Hell, I can barely cook up a decent working solution in double the time (and I have been writing React for a living for over three years now).

I decided to check how far I could get within a hard deadline of 90 minutes, hence, this project. Pardon the poor commit history. Git was the last thing on my mind.

## How far did I get?

The project snapshot at the end of the 90 minute mark is tagged [0.8](https://github.com/schowdhuri/react-calendar-challenge/tree/v0.8).

**What works**

- Add reminders
- Display reminders sorted by time
- Edit reminder
- Delete reminder
- Change months

**What doesn't**
- Color selection (completely missed this :confounded: )
- Selecting date when adding/editing a reminder


I plan on continuing the project until I cover all the requirements, while tracking the total time I take to see it through to the end.

## Screenshots

Well, it isn't much of a looker :sweat_smile:

## Closing Thoughts

Such 'coding challenges' are a very poor way to judge an engineer. The hallmark of a 'senior developer', nonetheless, is the ability to architect a scalable solution to a problem - basically, handling the entire software development life cycle, end to end; understand and enforce good design patterns; mentor juniors.

A race against time to ship a hacky product is a terrible assessment methodology.


### Discussion Threads

Apparently, I am not the only one against this kind of 'interviewing'. Sample this:
